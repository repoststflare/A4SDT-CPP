# A4SDT-CPP

This repository hosts the C++/Qt rewrite of A4SDT (the Audio-4 SDT program). The goal is to provide a native high-performance implementation, including:

- A modular effects engine with GPU acceleration.
- A modern UI built with Qt Quick for gradients and 3D styling.
- Integration with FFmpeg for audio/video decode and encode.
- Plugin architecture for adding new effects.

The initial commit includes a basic project structure. More features will be added over time.
